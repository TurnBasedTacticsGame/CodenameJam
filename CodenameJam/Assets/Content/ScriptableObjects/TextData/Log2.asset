      this is easily the biggest, maybe in this coast. At least it\u2019s easy walking...
      Still, I start getting real munchsome because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019ll
      be down here that long. So I start going back up.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying
      that I am lost but I\u2019m lost. I retraced my steps exactly, but I can\u2019t
      find the exit. It seems the only way I can go is out maybe. I can tough it
      out for a few more hours."
