  - text: "The geological yields to the biological. I wish I had better instruments
      with me, but I did not know that the anomaly would be so extensive. The transition
      zone is fascinating to me, and makes me wonder if it has always been here or
      if the flesh is creeping in from further in. Could the meat eventually escape
      into the outside world? There is stomach acid on the floor now, sizzling against
      my shoes. I\u2019m descending into the belly of something. I wonder if I am
      more meal, parasite, or intruder. \r\n\r\nI will not escape, I know this. My
      only hope is to preserve these notes and let someone else who may escape to
      see them. I hope that person is reading these notes now."
