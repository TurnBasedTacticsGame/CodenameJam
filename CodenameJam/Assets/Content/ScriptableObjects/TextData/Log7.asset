      This is a singularity of impossibilities. This is not possible, not known to
      science as we know it. Walls and walls and walls of meat welcoming me in. I
      am in the belly of something greater than myself, greater than my species,
      than my awareness, and I cannot help but be in awe of it. Something wishes
      to gorge itself on my being and my flesh and I am inside of that something.
      \r\n\r\nI know the nature of it.\r\n\r\nLet it devour us."
