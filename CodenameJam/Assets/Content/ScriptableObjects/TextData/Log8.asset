      has been my plaything for years, I have a right to it. I have a right to rule.
      We have tapped into a power they cannot fathom and we summoned it onto this
      mortal plane to do our bidding. \r\n\r\nIt will do my bidding, I know, even
      as flesh and unholy life sprung out of the ritual circle, devouring the cavern.
      Devouring my companions. I will not bow to it; I have never bowed to anything
      in my life. I will tame this power, I will best it, and when I do, I will truly
      be a God."
